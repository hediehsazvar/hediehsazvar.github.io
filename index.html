        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          Iam a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences Department at Northwestern University, advised by Professor Seyed M.R. 
          Iravani and Professor Sanjay Mehrotra. My research develops optimization and stochastic models for online matching platforms, 
          motivated by healthcare staffing marketplaces such as nurse-to-shift assignment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I study sequential job recommendation and assignment problems in which a platform recommends limited-capacity jobs (e.g., shifts) to agents (e.g., traveling nurses) who arrive over time, 
          have heterogeneous preferences, and may not ultimately show up. These settings create a challenging revenue management problem: the platform must allocate scarce, 
          perishable capacity and decide when to overbook, while accounting for uncertainty about future arrivals, acceptance, and no-shows, with the goal of maximizing filled jobs and expected revenue.
        </p>

        <p>
          My core contributions are structural and algorithmic. I analytically characterize optimal recommendation policies and prove their structural properties, then design scalable, 
          structure-guided heuristic algorithms that translate these insights into implementable decision rules. In my current work, I extend this framework to dependent preferences and
          capacity-constrained assortment optimization, and develop large-scale optimization methods—including mixed-integer reformulations and decomposition-based techniques—to obtain
          scalable solutions in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also passionate about approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, and have worked on rollout-augmented lookahead policies
          for fork-join queueing systems using simulation-based evaluation.
