      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences Department at Northwestern University, advised by Professor Seyed M.R. Iravani and Professor Sanjay Mehrotra. My research develops optimization and stochastic models for <strong>online matching platforms</strong>, motivated by applications including <strong>healthcare staffing (nurse-to-shift), freelance marketplaces,
  and volunteer matching platforms</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I study sequential job recommendation and assignment problems in which a platform recommends limited-capacity jobs (e.g., shifts) to agents (e.g., traveling nurses) who arrive over time, have heterogeneous preferences, and may not ultimately show up. These settings create a challenging revenue management problem: the platform must allocate scarce, perishable capacity and decide when to overbook, while accounting for uncertainty about future arrivals, acceptance, and no-shows, with the goal of maximizing filled jobs and expected revenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core contributions are structural and algorithmic. I analytically characterize optimal recommendation policies and prove their structural properties, then design scalable, <strong> structure-guided heuristic algorithms </strong> that translate these insights into implementable decision rules. In my current work, I extend this framework to dependent preferences and capacity-constrained <strong>assortment optimization</strong>, and develop <strong>large-scale optimization methods</strong>—including mixed-integer reformulations and decomposition-based techniques—to obtain scalable solutions in practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am also passionate about approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, and have worked on rollout-augmented lookahead policies for fork-join queueing systems using simulation-based evaluation.
      </p>



      <!-- INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE -->
      <h2>Recent Industry Experience (Moloco, Ads)</h2>

      <p>
        In summer 2025, I was a <strong>Data Science Intern at Moloco</strong> on the Moloco Ads team. I evaluated Moloco Ads’ core throttling mechanism that selectively filters bid requests from exchanges by designing a rigorous campaign-level evaluation framework to quantify infrastructure–performance tradeoffs. I analyzed millions of auction-level bid requests to identify system-level performance patterns, applied statistical methods to separate noise from signal, and delivered reproducible analysis and documentation. The project resulted in actionable recommendations that significantly reduced performance risk for high-impact campaigns and improved the stability of throttling decisions.
